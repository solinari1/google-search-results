Google Search Results Page

Introduction:

This is my second HTML/CSS mini-project. It is inspired from The Odin Project.

The goal of this project is to rebuild the Google.com search results page. 


Conclusion and Final thoughts

Skills involved:

- Using div to separate sections
- Grabbing URL and images of an existing webpage
- Creating a horizontal navbar and a footer
- Using classes & ids for CSS styling
- Centering elements horizontally and vertically
- Positioning and displaying elements correctly
- Using developer tools to grab CSS style and code

Building on what I learned in the previous project, I tackled a more advanced HTML/CSS assignment. It took me around 5 hours to complete the whole thing.

I mainly struggled with display and positioning of elements. I had to use padding/margin to make a few adjustments along the way which took quite a bit of time.

I also need to learn more about responsive design and how different CSS code impacts different window sizes.

All in all, I am quite satisfied with the end result and I actually found myself enjoying the process quite a lot!
